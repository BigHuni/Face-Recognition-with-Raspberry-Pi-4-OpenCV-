# Face Recognition with Raspberry Pi 4 (OpenCV)

### OpenCV technology for real-time face recognition using Raspberry Pi 4
###### Connect the Raspberry Pi with the camera and proceed as follows

###### Step 1 Data Collection
- This is a code that pre-captures the face of the person you want to recognize with the camera linked to the Raspberry Pi 4 and saves it in the PC. The more you shoot, the more data accumulates.

###### Step 2 data training
- Based on the photos stored in the PC, the code learns that the person is not 'Unknown'.

###### Step 3 Data Recognition
- Pre-work on the number of people you want to recognize through the camera and what name they will recognize and exhibit.
